            Imoto was my final thesis project in film school and was filmed
            during the winter of 2018-2019. It was the first film project in
            which I had complete creative freedom, with zero limitations on the
            genre, length and style. The project took two months to complete and
            was definitely the most demanding project Iâ€™ve taken part in. Prior
            to this project, I was used to shooting documentaries. When shooting
            a documentary, you have the opportunity to be spontaneous and not
            really know what shots you'd capture during the day. For me this is
            one of the most exciting things about documentary filmmaking. IMOTO
            took me completely out of my comfort zone as everything had to be
            meticulously planned, including the script, shot list, lighting,
            sound, framing, directing actors, negotiating locations and
            rehearsals.

            During this time I was heavily inspired by the works of Takeshi
            Kitano and Wong-Kar Wai. I loved the films of Takeshi Kitano because
            of the way he wrote his characters. They could range from a hardened
            yakuza thug to a quirky, innocent kid but they all shared humorous,
            relatable and wholesome qualities that made you very attached to
            them. With the Wong-Kar Wai films, I loved how the plot tended to
            follow a day in the life of several characters and this was
            something I wanted to replicate in my script. The cinematography of
            Christopher Doyle paired with the backdrop of a neon-lit, bustling
            East Asian city, was something completely magnetic about his
            movies. I wanted to pay homage to these two great directors and
            decided to use inspiration from both in my thesis film.

            The story follows Riku and Mai, two siblings from Japan, as they learn that
            their older brother has been killed back in their hometown. An old
            family friend travels to Berlin to warn them about the
            imminent danger coming their way.
